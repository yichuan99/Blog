I didn't make progress on my Node.js learning due to my school workload. 

The goal for this week is to hit 135/135 Node.js course video and have a basic grasp on SQL. 


## Updated Plan##
2018/05/20 -- Finish learning node.js basic usage and build some small project to enhance the understanding. Finish the book "SQL in 10 minutes"

2018/05/31 -- node.js, PostgreSQL/MongoDB and JavaScript should now be glued together. 

2018/06/07 -- A backend framework with all the modules integrated. (a full stack) This thing should now run on an AWS server. The course catalog should be done.
