## Intro ##
This series serves as a work log for my first full stack web application. I want to do full stack for following reasons: 

1. I want to see how a web application works from end to end.
2. I want solve problems with the knowledge I learned and the knowledge I will learn.
3. My school (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, aka RPI) doesn't have public course evaluation, and I will change that for the benefit of students. 

## Plan ##
