## Intro ##
This series serves as a work log for my first full stack web application. I want to do full stack for following reasons: 

1. I want to see how a web application works from end to end.
2. I want solve problems with the knowledge I learned and the knowledge I will learn.
3. My school (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, aka RPI) doesn't have public course evaluation, and I will change that for the benefit of students. 

## Plan ##
The goal is to deploy a fully functional application by 2018/08/15, and here is the time line:

2018/03/25 -- Start

2018/04/01 -- Finish learning JavaScript basics

2018/04/08 -- Finish learning node.js basic usage.

2018/04/15 -- Finish learning PostgreSQL basic usage.

2018/04/22 -- node.js, PostgreSQL and JavaScript should now be glued together. 

2018/05/01 -- A backend framework with all the modules integrated. (a full stack) This thing should now run on an AWS server. The course catalog should be done. 

2018/05/08 -- Course search functionality. 

2018/05/15 -- Average work load feature.

2018/05/22 -- Comment section feature.

2018/05/29 -- Relative difficulty feature. 

2018/06/01 -- A prototype application with all core functionalites. (course search, comment system, average hr/week rating, relative difficulty). These functions should be available through a barebone user interface. 

2018/06/15 -- Finish backend testing.

2018/07/01 -- A user friendly interface. 

2018/07/08 -- Migration to Docker.

2018/07/15 -- Migration to Kubernetes.

2018/07/22 -- End-to-end testing.

2018/07/29 -- System stress test.

2018/08/06 -- Deployment. (expose to public)

2018/08/15 -- Maintainance. 

I believe in small and defined progress, and I will use Agile methodology for this application. There will be progress report each week (every Saturday 11:00am EST except for this week), and the plan will be modified accordingly. Let's see how it goes. I'm excited.
