I cannot explain this well, but I think this might change my life. To clarify, "the hive mind" is an idea, it just exploded in my mind and I feel things are a little different. When I see people, I don't see individual people, but I see dots. When I see the world, I feel like the world is one single thing, its complexity is beyond my conprehension, but I feel that it is a SINGLE THING. It feels like asking "why" on a larger scale. 

Here are some links that better explains my thoughts somehow:
