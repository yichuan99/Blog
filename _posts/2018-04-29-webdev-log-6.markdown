I have covered 90/135 videos in the udemy nodejs tutorial, the progress is normal, and I will keep at it. I have finished making a basic RESTful API that can perform CRUD operations on MongoDB. I also learned basic usage of GET,POST,DELETE,PATCH commands in HTTP. I have also covered the hash/salt part in authentication and header tokens. I will keep working on this tutorial and by end of next Sunday (5/6) I should finish the authentication (user sign up/log in) part of the course. The goal is to finish 105/135 of the videos by 5/6. 

The final week is coming up, and there is nearly no time for me to focus on the app build. If I were to put all my effort into the nodejs course, I should be able to cover all 135 videos within a week.

There are several big school things that will happen during next week: (4/29~5/6)

Capstone Course Wrap up:
A final presentation
A 80 pages paper (8 people working collectively)
A poster session 

Deep Learning course wrap up:
A final home work that worth 10% of total grade (due 5/1) (ask help, finish within 6 hrs)
A final project that worth 20% of total grade (due 5/8) (ask help, finish within 3 days/ 20 hours)

Econometric course wrap up:
X 3~4 problem Sets due on 4/30 (finish within 4 hrs)
X A Lab report due on 4/30 (finish within 2 hrs)
X Email TA about two missing review quizzes (important) (due 4/30) (email, review, appointment, finish within 3 hrs total)
X Final exam coming up on 5/10 (the last school thing), calculator allowed, need at least 18 hours of review. 

RCOS course wrap up:

It will be hard to squeeze time out of such a tight time plan. I will learn nodejs whenever I finish something earlier than expected. Let's rock and roll!
