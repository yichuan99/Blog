Systems and technologies can be infinitely complex, yet human brain has limited capacity, and least mine has. However, it is definitely possible for a person to fully understand and implement a system that is far above his brain capacity.

Use these four things to zoom in and zoom out on a complex system:

NIMI:

Name: The entry point to a concept.

Interface: How you use it.

Model: A theoretical architecture about how it works.

Implementation: Full-fledged working thing. 

When you zoom in, you see the implementation of a single model. When you zoom out, you see more than one interfaces , each of which represents a module, interacting with each other. And now you know how to understand the big thing. 

This NIMI model also let you precisely control how much you should know about each components of the system, and how you should learn them. There are two good examples: 1. when you uses a third party module, all you need is it's interface. Knowing the interface is the most efficient way to get value from that module. 2. WHen you learn something, you MUST know it's model; it's better if you can build an implementation of it (and it's important). But you won't learn anything if you touches only the interface, and you cannot learn effectively if you want to skip the model and jump right into the implementation. (sometimes you might get the implementation working without thinking about the model, but that's usually because you are smart enough to reverse engineer from the implementation to the model. When handling large complex system, you just don't have the brain capacity to do that.)
