These are some of the concepts or names that I came across and think are useful. At the time of seeing them, I don't have time to spend much time on them. So I will record them here as a memo. 

Today's Keyword:

1. Blockchain -- Forget about bitcoin. Blockchain is so much bigger than that.

2. Smart Contract -- A new way of doing business in a peer-to-peer manner. 

3. Ethereum 

4. EOS
