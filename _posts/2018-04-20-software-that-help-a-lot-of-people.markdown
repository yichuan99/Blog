If you spent 10 days and built a to-do list application and shared it to a friend, you helped 1 person with 10 days' of effort. If you shared your software to 10000 people, you helped 100 people with 10 days' effort. The cost of producing 1 copy of a software is basically the same as producing 1000000 copies of the software, and that's the beauty. 

My goal is to build software that helps a lot of people. 

I will discuss my approach below. 

1. The software product solves ONE clearly defined problem (pain-point) that everyone has. If your product tries to solve many problems, it won't satisfy everyone, and your customer can hate your product in many ways.  
2. The software product solves that problem really well (the best), so that everyone goes to your product when they have that problem. The software should solve the problem effectively, and is EASY to use. 
3. A product with 100 users is very different from that same product with 100000 users. (If Facebook has only 100 total active users, you will not use it.)
4. Software implementation is only one link in the whole solution. As a software engineer I should be aware of that.
