## Why This Series? ##  
Container technology is a hot technology, and if you are in the industry, you have probably heard of "Docker", the current leading tech firm that specialize in container. After a brief research, I believe that this technology will change part of how software works. So starting from now, I will dedicate approximately 60 minutes per week discussing it, and hopefully my discussion can bring you some insights. 

## Why Container? ## 
Before diving into why, I want to define a few things. My definitions are nowhere near perfect, but it will help you understand the information I'm trying to convey. 

1. Automation:
	Automation is the elimination of dependency of basic production unit on human labor. Such transformation has two advantages that are crucial for production: lower error rate and scaled productivity.

2. Standardization:
	Standardization is the creation of a common protocol that is accepted by different units. Such transformation largely reduces the complexity of communication and therefore boosts the variety of information that can be shared and used. 

Automation and standardization are no doubt crucial factors for mass production and effecient information sharing, and the container technology captured both of these traits. With software container, the need to configure runtime environment is no longer chained by human labor, you can configure once and run anywhere, and the configuration for future runtime environments is automated by the container. On the otherhand, software container provides a standardized protocol for software to be shipped, installed, maintained and used. This transformation greatly simplified the software lifecycle since you have a "one for all" template that fits different software. 

Think about how C language took over assembly. With assembly you must configure your program according to the specific machine since different machine uses different machine code. With C, however, all these configuration pain goes to the compiler, and the programmer just need to write one program, and it will run on all machines. Do you smell any similarity between C vs Assembly and Container vs traditional software? If you do, you feel what I feel. Yes, the software container technology will lead a revolution, and it will change how people view software.
