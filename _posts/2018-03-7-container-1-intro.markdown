# Learn Some Container #1 -- Introduction #
## Why This Series? ##
Container technology is a hot technology, and if you are in the industry, you have probably heard of "Docker", the current leading tech firm that specialize in container. After a brief research, I believe that this technology will change part of how software works. So starting from now, I will dedicate approximately 60 minutes per week discussing it, and hopefully my discussion can bring you some insights. 

## Why Container? ##
Before diving into why, I want to define a few things. My definitions are nowhere near perfect, but it will help you understand the information I'm trying to convey. 

1. Automation:
	Automation is the elimination of dependency of basic production unit on human labor. Such transformation has two advantages that are crucial for production: lower error rate and scaled productivity.

2. Standardization:
	Standardization is the creation of a common protocol that is accepted by different units. Such transformation largely reduces the complexity of communication and therefore boosts the variety of information that can be shared and used.
