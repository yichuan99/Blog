These are some of the concepts or names that I came across and think are useful. At the time of seeing them, I don't have time to spend much time on them. So I will record them here as a memo. 

Today's Keyword:

1. LevelDB -- A fast key-value pair store that is well documented, well structured. It's a very good learning source for database implementation. (Google, Jeff Dean, Bigtable, LSM tree)

2. Redis

3. Protocol Buffer. -- Data Transfer 

4. Skip list -- A data structure used in replacement of binary search trees. Self-balancing is based on a radom procedure and is much simpler than tree balancing. Skip list is the underlying data structure for LevelDB's memtable.
