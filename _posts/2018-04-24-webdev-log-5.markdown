I have covered 61/135 videos in the udemy nodejs tutorial, the progress is normal, and I will keep at it. After this week I should know how to write a simple RESTful application!

Here is the updated plan (no change):

## Plan ##
2018/05/09 -- Finish learning node.js basic usage and build some small project to enhance the understanding. 

2018/05/20 -- Finish learning PostgreSQL basic usage.
